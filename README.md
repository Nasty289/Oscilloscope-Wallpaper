This is my first public program written in C#

The code is not clean, and propably very inefficient, but good enough for me!

I must say, the term "Wallpaper" should be taken lightly. I tried getting it to render behind desktop icons but cant seem to make it do that :/

It's more of a fullscreen Oscilloscope emulator. Not clean, not good, but fine with me!

It reads your Audio Output and displays the image accordingly;

Here is an example while playing [Jerobeam Fenderson's - Reconstruct](https://open.spotify.com/track/1vttIWlr6FaOOhkidhOeIb?si=c9769e362f304f96)

Again, not clean, but good enough for me!
